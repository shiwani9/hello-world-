"This repository is for practicing how to creat a branch in github."
steps involve to create a branch are:
1. Click the Code tab of your hello-world repository.
2. Above the file list, click the dropdown menu that says main.
3. Type a branch name, readme-edits, into the text box.
4. Click Create branch: readme-edits from main.
Now you have two branches, main and readme-edits. Right now, they look exactly the same. Next you'll add changes to the new readme-edits branch.
